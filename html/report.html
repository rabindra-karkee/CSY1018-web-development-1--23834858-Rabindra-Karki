                <p class="exp"> It was a fun adventure that required a lot of hard effort and perseverance to learn <br>the
                    fundamentals of web development, code, design, and debugging. Understanding HTML required knowing
                    how to structure web pages with tags and components as the first step. It was first fairly
                    difficult, but the more the learner practiced, the simpler it became.</p>
                <p class="exp">Understanding the principles of HTML and CSS at first was difficult and perplexing. The student found
                    it difficult to design webpages that were visually appealing and had trouble understanding the
                    fundamental ideas. The learner did, however, start to advance with perseverance and regular
                    practice.</p>

                    Debugging code posed one of the biggest difficulties faced while learning. It took time and careful
                    attention to spot mistakes and repair them.</p>
                <p class="exp">Discovering the tiny fault took a lot of time. Yet as time went on debuging got more relaxed.Creating
                    beautiful web pages in a variety of designs and layouts was a difficult element of the learning
                    process. Choosing the proper font, color, and size combinations for a web page was a difficult
                    process. Nonetheless, it got simpler to build an appealing web page via experimenting and the use of
                    design tools.</p>
